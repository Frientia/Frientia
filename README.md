## Profile Summary

I am an undergraduate Informatics Engineering student focused on backend development and system-level application logic.

My interest is centered on **how backend systems behave during real implementation**, including data flow, role-based logic, transaction order, and feasibility under limited constraints (academic or small-scale projects).

Most of my experience comes from academic and learning-based projects, where I typically contribute by:
- analyzing backend flow and relational data structure
- identifying inconsistencies between conceptual design and implementation
- questioning designs that exceed realistic team or time constraints

I am still strengthening execution discipline, particularly in handling detailed specifications, edge cases, and sustaining focus through less engaging implementation phases.

## Core Strengths (Observed in Practice)

- Backend-oriented problem analysis
- Logical evaluation of system flow and data relationships
- Relational database modeling (small–medium scale)
- Identifying inconsistencies between design assumptions and implementation
- Structuring academic project work around backend requirements

---

## Current Scope & Limitations

I am most comfortable working on **small to medium-scale backend systems** within academic or learning-focused environments.

Areas I am actively improving:
- maintaining consistency through detailed or repetitive implementation work
- committing to design decisions instead of over-framing alternatives
- handling edge cases more systematically

I do not claim experience with large-scale or production-critical systems.

---

## Learning Direction

- Writing clearer and more maintainable backend logic
- Improving system planning under realistic constraints
- Strengthening JavaScript fundamentals
- Preparing for internship-level backend or system-oriented roles
